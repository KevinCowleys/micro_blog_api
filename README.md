## Description

This is a demo api quickly built to replicate Twitter. My first Ruby on Rails api, there's a ton of room for improvement.

**Not recommended for deployment**

Would need proper rate limiting and probably other features after testing with a front-end application. Would also need proper cleanup and seperating some variables as environment variables.

## Dependencies

This application requires:

* Ruby 3.0.3
* Rails 6.1.4.1

How to install [Ruby on Rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D9d0wmwHVQ).

## Configure Application

```
bundle install
```

```
yarn
```

## Create Demo DB

```
rails db:create
```
```
rails db:migrate
```
The following command creates demo data in the DB
```
rails db:seed
```

## Start Rails Server

```
rails s
```

## Test API routes

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Admin Account

The following details for the admin account is only available when you've finished seeding the database.

Email: `admin@fake.com`  
Password: `password`
